 *   attempted, and its failure extends the same note (never a second note,
 *   never a silent skip)
 * - no refreshKey + active  → skipped note telling the user to re-run
 *   `aiand <id> on` (the adapter does not persist a plaintext key)
 * - refreshKey present      → try it, even when inactive: a marked config
 *   with a bad baseURL reads inactive yet still holds our key. refreshKey
 *   reports whether it touched a marked config, so unmarked files stay
 *   silent
 * - inactive + unmarked     → no note
 *
 * launcherOnly adapters are skipped. Never throws: a probe or refresh
 * failure becomes a `failed` note rather than aborting the login.
