#
# Installs the latest ai& CLI release into ~/.aiand/cli and drops an `aiand`
# launcher on PATH via ~/.local/bin. The release is the npm tarball for the
# version the latest GitHub release names; it must match both npm's sha512
# (`dist.integrity`) and the sha256 in that GitHub release's SHA256SUMS, or
# nothing is installed (docs/adr/0001-installers-verify-npm-release.md).
# There is no fallback to the main branch: with no release reachable, the
# installer stops. Those checks cover the tarball, not this script: a fresh
# install runs it as fetched from GitHub, before anything is verified (the
# one-liner takes it from the latest release's assets, not main), so the
# bootstrap is trusted on first use. `update` runs the copy that shipped in
# an already verified tarball.
# Re-running the installer replaces the previous install only after the new
# one is staged and verified — a failed stage leaves the old install
# untouched. The installer never rewrites or deletes anything under
# ~/.config/aiand (profiles, credentials, agent snapshots) — updating the CLI
# never unwires your agents. Answering yes to the closing login question runs
# `aiand login`, which stores a session there.
#
# `update` installs the latest release (or AIAND_VERSION) over an existing
# install. It always takes the release path, even when this script sits in a
# checkout or AIAND_SOURCE is set. Run from an install's own copy, it updates
# that install unless AIAND_DIR names another.
#
# `uninstall` turns every aiand-routed agent `off` first (via the installed
# CLI's `aiand init --off`, aborting before deleting anything when off fails
# so snapshots stay retryable), then removes the launcher and the
# checkout. Profiles, credentials, and snapshots under ~/.config/aiand are
# intentionally kept, unless `--purge` asks for a wipe (for a shared or loaner
# machine): then the installed CLI first runs `aiand logout --all` (or, on a
# CLI without it, `aiand logout` for every profile), which revokes the keys it
# minted and strips every agent's wiring, and the config directory is deleted
# after the files. The purge stops, deleting nothing, unless every key the CLI
# minted reports revoked (`--force` skips sign-out and says so). Like the checkout, that directory must canonicalize to a
# path strictly inside HOME, and its name must be `aiand`. An existing
# ~/.local/bin/aiand this installer did not write is never overwritten,
# executed, or removed.
